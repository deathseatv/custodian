GAME OVERVIEW
The game is a single-player, legacy-driven ARPG with no traditional character levels.
Progression is defined by player decisions, preparation, and irreversible commitments,
not by experience points or linear power curves.
The player is a persistent meta-entity that deploys characters into dangerous worlds.
Camera/feel target: Diablo-like interaction model, top-down isometric, real-time.

TARGET PLATFORM
PC (Steam)
Keyboard + mouse only (no controller support for now)
Target resolution: 640x360
No modding support planned
Data-driven content desired (monsters/items/etc. from data tables)
Expected concurrent dynamic entities:
Typical: 20–30
Hard ceiling: ~100 (excluding tiles/background)

PLAYER IDENTITY
The player exists as a non-combat meta-entity called the Wisp.
The Wisp:
Cannot enter combat or portals
Cannot die
Exists only in the hub
Represents continuity across characters
Characters are vessels inhabited by the Wisp.
Characters are tools, histories, and investments, not the player itself.

CAMERA AND CONTROLS
Perspective: Top-down isometric
Combat: Real-time
Control scope: Single controlled entity (one character)
Future idea (out of scope): Optional AI ally Wisp post-story

INPUT MODEL
Core interaction: Highlight-under-cursor determines click intent (Diablo-style)
Enemy highlighted:
Click attacks or move-to-attack
Item highlighted:
Click moves to pick up
Interactable highlighted:
Click moves to interact
Ground highlighted:
Click moves to position
Input density (initial): One primary action at a time
Possible extensions:
Chorded inputs (Ctrl+click / Ctrl+key)
Click-drag or hold behaviors

HUB STRUCTURE (WISP HUB)
The game boots directly into the Wisp hub.
There is no main menu.
The hub contains:
A gallery of all characters (active, wounded, retired)
A fixed number of portal slots (4–5)
Crafting and preparation interfaces
The hub is safe, persistent, and outside all danger.
All strategic decisions are made in the hub.

HUB NAVIGATION AND INHABITATION
The hub is navigated spatially.
Characters are represented as statues/husks.
Interaction flow:
Left-click husk to approach
Prompt: “Inhabit this husk?” (Yes / No)
On Yes: Player inhabits the character
Crafting is handled via UI (not diegetic stations).
Time does not pass in the hub.

CHARACTERS
Characters:
Have finite lives
Have use-based growth (no levels)
Develop mastery through repeated actions
Can die, retire, and leave legacy
Specialization emerges naturally through use and equipment.
Characters cooperate indirectly via shared hub resources.

LIVES AND DEATH
Characters have a limited number of lives.
A life is lost only on death during an expedition.
Quitting the game never costs a life.
Crashes and interruptions are never punished.
When lives reach zero:
Character can no longer be deployed
Forced retirement occurs
Character becomes a legacy figure

EXPEDITIONS
An expedition begins when a character enters a portal.
An expedition ends when:
The character exits safely
The character dies
The player explicitly closes the portal instance
Failure conditions:
No failure without death except closing the portal
Forced exits only via future story events (not baseline)
Partial success:
Completing some objectives and exiting is valid

PORTALS
Portals are consumable world instantiations.
Portals are crafted using materials.
Portals occupy limited hub slots.
Portals are not fast travel.
Opening a portal is a commitment.
The hub is the only town.

PORTAL VARIANTS (PLACEHOLDERS)
General hostile expedition portals
Boss-only portals
Treasure vault portals
Rule-shift / special-rule portals

PORTAL STATES
Empty:
No portal in slot
Open:
Portal active and explorable
Dormant:
A character died inside
Slot locked until resolved

PORTAL PERSISTENCE
If a character dies in a portal:
Portal becomes Dormant
All dropped items remain inside
Slot cannot be overwritten
Items remain recoverable while portal exists.
Closing a portal destroys all remaining contents.
Portal closure is always an explicit decision.

CHARACTER SWITCHING DURING EXPEDITIONS
Players may return to the hub and switch characters mid-expedition.
Restrictions:
Cannot switch during combat or active aggro
Cannot switch if damage was taken recently
Return-to-hub is a channeling action and can be interrupted
Switching does not grant free healing or cooldown resets.
Inactive characters are in stasis.
Enables specialist solutions and logistics runs.

ITEMS AND GEAR
Power is externalized into gear, not characters.
Items:
Have bases (weapon, armor, etc.)
Have sockets
Can host constructs
Gear is shared across characters via the hub.
Dropped gear persists while the portal exists.

ITEM RECOVERY
On character death:
Items drop in the portal world
Items are not automatically lost
Another character may recover them.
Recovery is risky but never forced.

CONSTRUCTS
Constructs are crafted spell-like systems embedded into items.
Primary constructs provide active abilities.
Constructs are mostly irreversible once embedded.
Scaling occurs via materials, refinement, and commitment.
Progression favors new behaviors over infinite numbers.

CONSTRUCT TYPES
Primary Construct:
One per item
Defines core active behavior
Provides a bindable active ability
Modifier Constructs:
Multiple per item
Passive only
Modify triggers, conditions, scaling, or side effects

CONSTRUCT FAILURE / INSTABILITY
Constructs do not inherently misfire or backfire.
Instability is an optional modifier category (e.g., high power with drawbacks).

EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCT SCOPE
Initial target: 4 construct-capable equipment slots
Possible expansion: Up to 8
Each primary construct can be bound to a quickcast key.

MASTERY SYSTEM
Mastery is use-based and passive.
Any character can use any weapon at a basic level.
Mastery improves expression, not baseline usability.
Mastery is per character and per weapon type.
Additional mastery lines may exist (e.g., construct proficiency).
Mastery does not decay.
No hard cap:
Early mastery unlocks mechanics
Late mastery unlocks passive numeric bonuses
Some construct behaviors require mastery thresholds.

MASTERY VISIBILITY
Mastery is visible on the character stats sheet.
Stats sheet is informational only (no point allocation).
Includes scrollable explanations of masteries and stats.

PORTAL ACCESS (NO TIERS)
No level or tier requirements.
Portals defined by multi-axis danger profiles.
Access gated by cost, preparation, and survivability.

DANGER AXES
Enemy density
Burst lethality
Attrition pressure
Resistance skew
Punishment severity
Recovery scarcity
Environmental hostility
Axes are independent and non-linear.

DANGER AXES ROLE
Danger axes act as world generation parameters.
Other generation parameters may drive AI behavior.

PORTAL VISUALIZATION
Single composite visual intensity represents overall risk.
Qualitative motifs represent individual danger axes.
No numbers or success prediction are shown.

PLAYER-SELECTED DIFFICULTY
Difficulty is chosen during portal creation.
Players may add modifiers increasing danger axes.
Higher danger increases:
Rewards
Prestige yield
Risk
Failure is attributable to player choice.

CHARACTER-RELATIVE PERCEPTION
Portals are absolute.
Characters perceive strain relative to strengths.
Only partial, axis-specific strain signals are shown.
No aggregate difficulty verdict is given.

TWINKING AND EARLY SKIPPING
Gear sharing is allowed.
Portal slots are limited.
High-risk portals displace low-risk ones.
Skipping early content is allowed but costly.

SAVE / PERSISTENCE MODEL
Persistent world-state model (Minecraft-like).
On quit/crash/reload:
Player resumes exact previous state
No punishment for interruptions
Expedition state is persistent by default.
Portal closure remains explicit and destructive.

RETIREMENT
Characters may retire voluntarily or at zero lives.
Retirement is never deletion.
Retired characters remain visible in the gallery.

LEGACY SYSTEM
On retirement, legacy is distributed via:
Knowledge Legacy (crafting unlocks, constructs, system access)
Material Legacy (partial rare material retention)
Artifact Legacy (distilled items → blueprints/shards/heirlooms)
Legacy scales with investment and risk.

PRESTIGE SYSTEM
Prestige modifies how quickly new characters gain proficiency.
Derived from retiring character’s mastery.
Prestige amplifies continuity; it is not a reset mechanic.

BLAZE OF GLORY INCENTIVE
High-risk actions near end-of-life:
Increase prestige yield
Improve legacy quality
Failure still produces value.
Success produces more.

LONG-TERM PLAY STRUCTURE
Hours:
Tactical combat and immediate decisions
Days:
Crafting goals and portal planning
Weeks:
Character specialization and region mastery
Months:
Prestige cycles and meta-unlocks
Years (optional):
System expansion without invalidating legacy

NARRATIVE APPROACH
Game functions without explicit lore or dialogue.
Story emerges from deaths, recoveries, retirements, and legacy.
Characters are husks.
The Wisp is the constant.
The world explains itself through systems.
Ending summary:
The player defeats an apparent antagonist, glimpses a higher abstraction layer where both Wisps are reduced to objects, and returns—aware that progression was never about escape, but participation.

CORE DESIGN THESIS
Progress is defined by decisions, not numbers.
Risk is chosen, not imposed.
Failure creates new gameplay.
Characters matter.
Legacy outlives any single run.

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW NOTE
Slices come first.
Categories are derived by grouping slices by shared systems.
Goal: Build systems that unlock the maximum number of slices sequentially.

FIRST IDEAL VERTICAL SLICE (REFERENCE)
Hub navigation and inhabit character
One open portal slot
Enter portal instance
Click-to-move and click-to-attack
One enemy type
One interactable or pickup
Exit portal back to hub
Persistent state on quit/reload
