DESIGN SUPPLEMENT
This document supplements the original ARPG design file and prior supplements.
It records firm decisions made in response to pre-slice boundary questions.
Any system not mentioned here remains unchanged.

COMBAT DAMAGE MODEL (DECISION)
Damage resolution uses a hybrid model (Type C).
Primary damage:
Discrete attack events
Attack animation → hit frame → damage instance
Secondary damage:
Continuous / tick-based damage from overlapping effects
Examples include environmental hazards (fire, poison clouds, etc.)
Design intent:
Clear, readable combat events with selective area-based pressure

COLLISION AUTHORITY AND ENTITY SOLIDITY (DECISION)
Collision is evaluated in a 2D top-down logical space.
This logical space is projected to isometric for rendering only.
Entity solidity:
Determined per-entity via a solidity flag
Default behavior:
Fully solid entities cannot overlap
Exceptions:
Non-solid entities may overlap if flagged
Movement and collision calculations:
Performed in 2D top-down space
Visual isometric projection does not affect collision logic

TARGETING AND HIT DETECTION (DECISION)
Target selection:
Uses logical 2D space, not raw screen-space projection
Prevents incorrect highlighting of visually foreground entities
Melee attacks:
Target-locked abstractions
Projectiles:
Hitbox-based collision detection

DEATH RESOLUTION (DECISION)
Death resolves immediately upon receiving lethal damage.
On character death:
Screen flashes white briefly (approx. 0.25–0.5 seconds)
Control returns immediately to the Wisp
Simultaneous death:
Both sides may kill each other in the same frame

PORTAL WORLD STRUCTURE – EARLY SLICES (DECISION)
Early vertical slices use single arena-style portal spaces.
Purpose:
Integrate core mechanics before procedural generation
Procedural or multi-zone worlds are deferred to later slices.

ENEMY PERSISTENCE AND STASIS (DECISION)
Within a portal:
Enemies persist nearly exactly
Position, health, and state are preserved
When player exits portal or returns to hub:
Portal entities enter stasis
No AI updates
No damage-over-time ticking
No simulation progression
Design rationale:
Avoid simulating multiple active portals simultaneously
Maintain fairness and predictability for recovery runs
Future consideration (non-binding):
Multiplayer may require selective portals to remain active

AUDIO SCOPE (DECISION)
Audio is in scope from early vertical slices onward.
Each slice should include relevant placeholder or final audio cues
Combat hits
Deaths
UI interactions
