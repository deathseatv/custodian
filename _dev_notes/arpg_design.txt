GAME OVERVIEW
	The game is a single-player, legacy-driven RPG with no traditional character levels.
	Progression is defined by player decisions, preparation, and irreversible commitments,
	not by experience points or linear power curves.
	The player is a persistent meta-entity that deploys characters into dangerous worlds.

PLAYER IDENTITY
	The player exists as a non-combat meta-entity called the Wisp.
	The Wisp:
		Cannot enter combat or portals
		Cannot die
		Exists only in the hub
		Represents continuity across characters
	Characters are vessels inhabited by the Wisp.
	Characters are tools, histories, and investments, not the player itself.

HUB STRUCTURE (WISP HUB)
	The game boots directly into the Wisp hub.
	There is no main menu.
	The hub contains:
		A gallery of all characters (active, wounded, retired)
		A fixed number of portal slots (4–5)
		Crafting and preparation interfaces
	The hub is safe, persistent, and outside all danger.
	The hub is the place where all strategic decisions are made.

CHARACTERS
	Characters:
		Have finite lives
		Have use-based growth (no levels)
		Develop mastery through repeated actions
		Can die, retire, and leave legacy
	Each character specializes naturally through use and equipment.
	Characters cooperate indirectly through shared hub resources and goals.

LIVES AND DEATH
	Characters have a limited number of lives.
	A life is lost only when a character dies during an expedition.
	Quitting the game never costs a life.
	Crashes and real-life interruptions are never punished.
	When lives reach zero:
		The character cannot be deployed again
		The character must be retired (forced retirement)
		The character becomes a legacy figure

EXPEDITIONS
	An expedition begins when a character enters a portal.
	An expedition ends when:
		The character exits safely
		The character dies
	Expeditions are the only context where risk applies.
	Quitting mid-expedition pauses the state and resumes on reload.

ITEMS AND GEAR
	Power is externalized into gear, not characters.
	Items:
		Have bases (weapon, armor, etc.)
		Have sockets
		Can host constructs
	Gear is shared across characters via the hub.
	Gear dropped in the world persists while its portal exists.

CONSTRUCTS
	Constructs are crafted spell-like systems embedded into items.
	Constructs do not grant new buttons; they modify existing actions.
	Constructs are mostly irreversible once embedded.
	Constructs scale via materials, refinement, and commitment.
	Diminishing returns exist, but progression shifts into new behaviors instead of infinite numeric growth.

CONSTRUCT TYPES
	Primary Construct
		One per item
		Defines the item’s core active behavior
		Examples: fire burst on hit, defensive pulse on block
	Modifier Constructs
		Multiple per item
		Passive only
		Modify triggers, conditions, scaling, or side effects
	Construct economies are split between primary and modifier constructs.

MASTERY SYSTEM
	Mastery is use-based and passive.
	Mastery improves expression, not baseline usability.
	Any character can use any weapon at a basic level.
	Mastery unlocks:
		Timing windows
		Recovery cancels
		Ripostes
		Advanced interactions
	Some construct behaviors require mastery thresholds to fully activate.

PORTALS
	Portals are consumable world instantiations.
	Portals are crafted using materials.
	Portals occupy limited slots in the hub.
	Portals are not fast travel.
	Opening a portal is a commitment.

PORTAL STATES
	Empty
		No portal in the slot
	Open
		Portal is active and explorable
	Dormant
		Portal where a character died
		Slot is locked until resolved

PORTAL PERSISTENCE
	If a character dies in a portal:
		The portal becomes Dormant
		All items dropped remain inside
		The slot cannot be overwritten
	Items remain recoverable as long as the portal exists.
	Closing a portal destroys everything still inside.
	Portal closure is always an explicit player decision.

ITEM RECOVERY
	When a character dies:
		Their items drop in the portal world
		They are not automatically lost
	Another character may be deployed to recover them.
	Recovery is risky and intentional.
	Repeated failures increase pressure but never force loss.

PORTAL ACCESS (NO TIERS)
	There are no portal tiers or level requirements.
	Portals are defined by multi-axis danger profiles.
	New characters are not forbidden from dangerous areas,
	but are implicitly gated by cost, preparation, and survivability.

DANGER AXES
	Each portal has an absolute danger profile composed of axes such as:
		Enemy density
		Burst lethality
		Attrition pressure
		Resistance skew
		Punishment severity
		Recovery scarcity
		Environmental hostility
	Axes are independent and non-linear.
	There is no single difficulty stat.

PORTAL VISUALIZATION
	Portals have:
		A single composite visual intensity (color, turbulence, distortion)
			Represents overall risk density
		Multiple qualitative motifs
			Represent danger axes
	No numbers are shown.
	No success prediction is shown.

PLAYER-SELECTED DIFFICULTY
	Difficulty is never automatic.
	Difficulty is always chosen during portal creation.
	Players can add modifiers that increase danger axes.
	Higher danger:
		Increases rewards
		Increases prestige yield
		Increases risk
	Failure is always attributable to player choice.

CHARACTER-RELATIVE PERCEPTION
	Portals are absolute.
	Characters perceive strain relative to their strengths.
	Only partial, axis-specific strain signals are shown.
	No aggregate “easy/hard” verdict is ever shown.
	The game never tells the player which character will win.

TWINKING AND EARLY GAME SKIPPING
	Gear sharing is allowed.
	Portal slots are limited.
	Opening high-risk portals displaces low-risk ones.
	Power-leveling new characters costs opportunity.
	Skipping early content is allowed but never free.

SAVE SYSTEM
	Saving:
		Is only allowed in safe hub areas
		Costs a resource
		Cost scales slowly with depth or frequency
	Saving is a strategic decision, not a convenience.
	There is no save scumming.
	There is no forced save starvation.

RETIREMENT
	Characters can retire voluntarily or be forced to retire at zero lives.
	Retirement is never deletion.
	Retired characters remain visible in the gallery.

LEGACY SYSTEM
	When a character retires, legacy is distributed through channels:
	Knowledge Legacy
		Crafting unlocks
		Construct archetypes
		System access
	Material Legacy
		Partial retention of rare materials
	Artifact Legacy
		Items are distilled, not transferred
		Results in blueprints, shards, or weakened heirlooms
	Legacy is proportional to investment and risk taken.

BLAZE OF GLORY INCENTIVE
	High-risk actions near the end of a character’s life:
		Increase prestige yield
		Improve legacy quality
	Failure still produces value.
	Success produces more.
	Players are encouraged, not forced, to push limits.

LONG-TERM PLAY STRUCTURE
	Hours
		Tactical combat and immediate decisions
	Days
		Crafting goals and portal planning
	Weeks
		Character specialization and region mastery
	Months
		Prestige cycles and meta-unlocks
	Years (optional)
		System expansion without invalidating legacy

NARRATIVE APPROACH
	The game can function without dialogue or explicit lore.
	Story emerges from:
		Deaths
		Recoveries
		Retirements
		Legacy
	Characters are husks.
	The Wisp is the constant.
	The world explains itself through systems.
	One-sentence summary of the ending
		The player defeats an apparent antagonist, only to briefly glimpse a higher abstraction layer where both Wisps are reduced to objects, before being quietly returned to the game—now aware that progression was never about escape, but participation.

CORE DESIGN THESIS
	Progress is defined by decisions, not numbers.
	Risk is chosen, not imposed.
	Failure creates new gameplay.
	Characters matter.
	Legacy outlives any single run.
